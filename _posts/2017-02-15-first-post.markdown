This is the first post I'm writing in Github Page. I'm using Jekyll, at first this looks 
not easy but the real thing is that I was incorrectly using it. It's designed to be simple.
If you try to keep it simple it's quite impressive.
It allows you to write posts in markdown language and keep them in a organized structure.

Github blocks you from using plugins, so I believe you lose big amount of its power. 
Github gives you some themes, I wasn't able of using them and using jekyll as a blog.
So I have to build a css to give a good feel. 
I've followed this nice [post](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) for getting this result.

If you follow the post you get html templates for pages and blogs, 
that you can customize as you wish if you like writing html and css.
I've added some bootstrap, but mostly of it is still the same.

For adding blog posts you need only to create a md file, which you can write
using markdown language or html, in the `_posts` folder and 
it gets automatically added to the blog page and to the RSS feed.

Basically that is what I have to say about Jekyll. 
I've lost some until I found out what could I do with it so 
I just wish this post allows you to save some time.
Nevertheless I enjoyed the resulting page (This page you are reading) and I would recommend Jekyll 
if you need a webpage and if you need to use github pages.
