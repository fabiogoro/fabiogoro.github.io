This is the first post I'm writing in Github Page. I'm using Jekyll, at first touch this looks not easy.

But the real thing is that I was using it incorrectly. It's designed to be simple.
If you try to keep it simple it's quite impressive.
It allows you to write posts in markdown language and keep them in a organized structure.
Github blocks you from using plugins, so I believe you lose big amount of its power.

Github gives you some themes, I wasn't able of using them and using jekyll as a blog.
So I have to build a css to give a good feel. Meanwhile I just used some template I've seen in a good [post](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)

C ya. Bye.
