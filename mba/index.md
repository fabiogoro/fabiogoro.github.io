# Application of sensors in water distribution systems for detection of leaks

Controlling losses is a topic of utmost relevance amidst water utilities. A large
number of strategies are applied to control them. One of the strategies is to actively
search and sort leakage in the water distribution network. To optimize this strategy,
one could apply a wireless sensor network, which would capture information of the
water network in real time. This information might then be processed, detecting and
helping the leakage to be sorted faster by the utility personnel. This research project
will propose possible objects to be studied later. A bibliographic research is
presented in this text, where control of losses and application of technology will be
reviewed. This review will be used as a base for the propositions of this project. Also,
some analysis of existing experiments of wireless sensor networks are made, using
projects that are already executed and that have published results. The proposed
study objects have the goal of applying technology, in a way where the costs are
worth the benefits of loss reduction. This is accomplished by studying costs of
devices used in the network and evaluating the capacity of detection and localization
of the application, and thus, this is what the project is proposing.
