# Strategies for Matching Hummed Queries Melodies

<html>
<p>Strategies for matching extracted melodies from hummed song recordings with its handwritten counterpart are methodically reviewed and presented in a intuitive perspective.
Through several experiments, weaknesses and strengths of matching algorithms are thoroughly explored to create a comprehensive description of contexts and scenarios where it can be applied. 
For that, a database, the MIR-QBSH, was used, where 48 midi files (the handwritten melody) associated with respectives 4431 wav files (the hummed recordings).
Among the difficulties of such task are the imprecisions of translating hummed recordings to a symbolic representation, the need of defining what kind of similarity needs to be used in the desired context, and the need for scalable algorithms.</p>
